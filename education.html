                <p>
                    I spent about 10 years of my academic life here. This place is very memorable for me.
                    <br><br>
                    Completed my Secondary School Certificate(SSC) exam before graduation(grade-10), in 2017.
                    Passed with a GPA of 5.00 in all subjects.

                <p>
                    I spent very little time in this place. If I consider transitioning my school life to 
                    university life a train journey, then I can call this place a temporary-stoppage. It just
                    felt like a transition-phase for me. Nevertheless, it wasn't so bad.

                    I completed my Higher Secondary School Certificate(HSC) exam before graduation(grade-12), in 2019.

                    I've been studying Computer Science and Engineering here, since 2021. Currently, I am in my 2nd year.
                    This place is very distant from my hometown. So, travelling isn't easy.
                    But luckily, I've made some reliable friends. So, life here isn't too hard.

                    As a computer science student, so far I have learned about just the basics. Structured
                    programming(C), Object oriented programming(C++), built some projects, but nothing that special.
                    Still in the process of learning. 
                    <br><br>
                    Currently I am focusing fully on web development.
                    I am targeting to become a full stack web developer someday. 
                    Hence this is my first personal project.
